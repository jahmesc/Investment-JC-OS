# Alert Pack

Preset alert ideas for consistent notifications across assets.

## Structure
- **Session alerts:** Notify when price enters New York, London, or Asia ranges.
- **Level taps:** Alerts for manual Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 61.8%, 78.6%) and key weekly highs/lows.
- **Momentum shifts:** Conditions for bullish/bearish engulfing, inside bars, or market structure breaks.
- **Time of day:** Reminders at pre-session, open, mid-session, and close to review plans.

## How to use
1. Map levels and zones before setting alerts.
2. Use clear, action-oriented messages (e.g., `GBPUSD - NY 62% retrace tapped - wait for confirmation`).
3. Set expiration times so old levels do not trigger after conditions change.
4. Mirror alerts on correlated pairs only when relevant to reduce noise.

## Maintenance
- Audit alerts weekly and delete stale ones.
- Keep a short list of reusable templates in `examples/` for quick duplication.
