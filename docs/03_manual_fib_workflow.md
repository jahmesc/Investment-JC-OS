# Manual Fibonacci Workflow

Use this workflow to keep manual Fibonacci levels consistent across charts.

## Preparation
- Start on the 4H or 1H timeframe to identify the dominant swing.
- Confirm the bias (bullish or bearish) before placing levels.

## Steps
1. Anchor the 0% level at the swing low for bullish moves (swing high for bearish).
2. Place the 100% level at the opposite swing extreme.
3. Draw key retracement zones: 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%.
4. Mark premium/discount zones with colored boxes for quick visual reads.
5. Add confluence notes (time of day, session overlap, liquidity pools) with text labels.
6. Save a chart screenshot and store it in `examples/` for later review.

## Usage tips
- Avoid redrawing levels mid-session unless the higher timeframe swing changes.
- Pair Fibonacci zones with alert presets so you get notified when price taps preferred levels.
- Clear old levels weekly to keep charts clean.
