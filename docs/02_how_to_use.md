# How to Use the Overlay

This guide outlines the daily workflow for operating the Investing OS Overlay.

## Default layout
- Keep the overlay on your primary instrument and one correlated pair for context.
- Enable session background colors to quickly identify high-activity windows.
- Turn on volume and market structure panels you rely on; hide the rest to reduce noise.

## Daily routine
1. Open the chart at your pre-market time block.
2. Note overnight highs/lows and mark any significant gaps.
3. Set alert presets from `docs/04_alert_pack.md` on key levels.
4. Map manual Fibonacci levels as described in `docs/03_manual_fib_workflow.md`.
5. Document any planned trades with screenshots stored in `examples/`.

## Inputs to customize
- **Risk model profile:** Aligns with your position sizing rules.
- **Session to highlight:** Highlights your preferred trading window.
- **Alert messages:** Adjust the alert text so it feeds into your notification system cleanly.

## Saving templates
- Save a chart layout per asset class (e.g., FX, equities, crypto).
- Use the **Apply defaults to all charts** option after tuning your settings to keep layouts consistent.
