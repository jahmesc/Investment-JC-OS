# Install on TradingView

Use this checklist to load the Investing OS Overlay into your TradingView account.

1. Open TradingView and create or open a chart layout dedicated to this overlay.
2. Click **Pine Editor** and paste the contents of `pine/investing_os_overlay_v0_1.pine`.
3. Save the script with a name such as `Investing OS Overlay v0.1` and click **Add to Chart**.
4. In the **Settings** panel, configure your default risk model and session highlighting to match your trading hours.
5. Save the chart layout so your inputs persist across sessions.
6. Pin the script to your Favorites bar for quick access on additional charts.

## Troubleshooting
- If the overlay does not load, ensure you are on a supported TradingView plan for custom alerts.
- Delete and re-add the overlay if the chart state appears corrupted.
- Use the **More > Reset chart** option before reloading to clear stale drawings.
