# Weekly Routine

Run this checklist each weekend to keep the Investing OS Overlay aligned with your plan.

## Review
- Export screenshots of your best and worst trades into `examples/`.
- Tag setups that matched or deviated from your plan.
- Clear obsolete drawings and levels to start fresh.

## Preparation
1. Update watchlists for the coming week and flag high-impact news events.
2. Refresh manual Fibonacci levels on higher timeframes.
3. Rebuild alerts using the templates in `docs/04_alert_pack.md`.
4. Note structural shifts (trend changes, range breaks) and document them in your journal.

## Settings to reset
- Risk model defaults if your account size or volatility regime changed.
- Session highlights if you are trading a different timezone for the week.
- Alert expiration dates to avoid stale signals.

## Deliverables
- A clean chart layout saved as the new baseline.
- A short summary of focus pairs and scenarios for the week.
